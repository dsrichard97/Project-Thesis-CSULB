### 1. Executive Summary <a name="executive-summary"></a>

#### Project Overview  
This research develops a predictive staffing model for healthcare call centers, combining:  
- **Operational analytics** (call patterns, handling times)  
- **AI forecasting** (Prophet, ARIMA/SARIMA, ETS)  
- **Dashboard integration** for real-time decision making  

#### Key Insights  
- **Peak Demand**: Monday-Wednesday call volumes (10%+ higher than weekends)  
- **Cost Drivers**: HR represents 70-80% of operational expenses  
- **Model Approach**:  
  > "Like musical chairs - optimizing FTE 'seats' across 8-hour shifts"  

#### Implementation Value  
- Reduces staffing costs while maintaining service levels  
- Scales for large organizations (500+ employees)

### 2. Business Challenge <a name="business-challenge"></a>

#### Healthcare Context  
**Kaiser Permanente Case** (12.7M members):  
- Critical call center functions:  
  - âœ“ Medical appointments  
  - âœ“ Clinical advice  
  - âœ“ Insurance processing  
  - âœ“ Prescription management  
- **Pain Point**: 5% data volatility impacts staffing accuracy  

#### Research Hypotheses  

| Hypothesis                | Challenge                          | Solution Approach               |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Biweekly Allocation       | Align FTEs with demand swings      | Model-driven FTE estimates      |
| Real-Time Robustness      | Handle data fluctuations           | Adaptive forecasting models     |

### 3. About the Data <a name="about-the-data"></a>

#### Data Sources
- **Origin**: 
  - Customer Care Database (CCDB)
  - Telephone Database (TDB)
  - Email Database (EDB)
- **Timeframe**: January - October 2024
- **Content**:
  - Call timestamps, durations, reasons (patient/routine/service)
  - Masked PHI (HIPAA-compliant anonymization)

### 4. Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>

#### Call Volume Patterns
| Time Period          | Observation                           | Staffing Action                    |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Weekly Peaks**     | Highest volumes: Monday-Tuesday       | Increase RN/LVN shifts             |
| **Weekend**          | Sharp decrease: Saturday-Sunday       | Reduce staff                       |
| **Daily Peaks**      | 8 AM - 4 PM (Monday-Tuesday focus)    | Prioritize AM shifts               |
| **Overnight**        | Consistently low: 12 AM - 8 AM        | Minimal coverage                   |

#### Message Type Analysis
- **Longest Handling Time**:
  - Patient messages
  - Routine messages
  - Request messages

#### Seasonal Staffing Needs
- **Peak Demand (July-August)**:
  - Summer emergencies
  - Increased birth rates
  - Vacation coverage gaps
- **Steady Demand (Jan-Mar)**:
  - Flu season consistency

 ### 5. Modeling & Analysis <a name="modeling--analysis"></a>

#### Forecasting Framework
**Target**:  
Predict staffing needs \( S_t \) from:
- Daily `count`, `total_hrs`, and `AHT`  
- Message types: `Patient`, `Routine`, `Request`  

**Goals**:
1. Capture weekly/monthly trends  
2. Adjust for holidays and anomalies  
3. Optimize summer staffing  

#### Model Implementation
**Tools**:

### 6. Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>

#### GRNN Value
- **Short-term**: Accurate biweekly forecasts for `S_t2_RN`/`S_t2_LVN`  
- **Non-linear**: Outperforms ARIMA/ETS on 14-day horizons  

#### Key Limitations
- **Extrapolation**: Struggles with long-term predictions  
- **Adoption**: R code complexity challenges analysts  

#### Improvement Path
1. **Technical**:  
   - Hybrid modeling (GRNN + decomposition)  
   - Sigma tuning
   - Ensemble methods with lag windows  

2. **Operational**:  
   - External regressors (department inputs)  
   - Simplified business translations  

#### Business Outcome  
*"Established short-term staffing baselines, with long-term adoption requiring:"*  
- Model refinements  
- Statistical training for teams
